# Custom Recipes
In Minecraft, recipes are used by the player to craft or create certain items via
different crafting blocks, such as the crafting table, furnace, and stonecutter.

Custom crafting recipes can be added to a datapack via json files, which you can
learn about [here](./recipes/normal.md). Note that you cannot use custom nbt datas
as input or output for the recipes this way. However, there is a way to implement
custom nbt output with advancements and rewards, which you can learn about [here](./recipes/with_nbt.md).
